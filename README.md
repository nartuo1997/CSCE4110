Algorithm

### Closed/Opened Box Switching Assignment â€“ CSCE 4110: Algorithms

- Designed an algorithm using C++ to check how many boxes will be opened after in iteration with n boxes initiated as closed. 

- Proposed a solution that decreased time complexity from O(n2) to O(M(k)) where (M(k)) is the complexity of multiplying two k digit numbers.
